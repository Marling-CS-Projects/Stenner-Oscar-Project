| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                            | Result                                                                                                                                                                             |   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| 1         | Experience and levelling system. each level, more experience points are required, and more chance of gaining gym members.                              | As expected                                                                                                                                                                        |   |
| 2         | Boosts that can be purchased with in-game currency to provide temporary bonuses to the player's performance.                                           | As expected                                                                                                                                                                        |   |
| 3         | A challenge system that provides extra rewards for completing specific challenges.                                                                     | This will keep the game challenging enough to keep the players attention.                                                                                                          |   |
| 4         | A list of tasks and daily objectives at the top of the screen which can guide the player and help earn rewards.                                        | Having a list of objectives can help the game to feel more immersive as the player is able to focus on progressing.                                                                |   |
| 5         | A system which allows players to hire staff members, similar to managers,  which can be levelled up and organised to increase the rate of progression. | Similar to temporary upgrades and boosts, these will make the game more engaging. However staff members will be permanent and help the player manage progression through the game. |   |
| 6         | Different locations which can be levelled up and progressed through separately, with different benefits and features for each location.                | Having different locations will make the gameplay more interesting as the player will play the game differently depending on the current location.                                 |   |
| 7         | An interactive map where the player can view progression through different locations.                                                                  | A map will make the game engaging as the player will be able to view their progress on different sections of the map, and also overall progress.                                   |   |
| 8         | In-game events that provide extra rewards and challenges for a limited time.                                                                           | Time sensitive events will provide a sense of urgency for the player, making the game more fun to play.                                                                            |   |
| 9         | There will be NPCs who wander the environment.                                                                                                         | This will make the game feel more immersive and as though it is an actual gym.                                                                                                     |   |
| 10        | There will be a button which opens a window which displays a shop where the player can purchase equipment.                                             | This is a common feature of clicker games and will allow players to make purchases and to progress.                                                                                |   |
| 11        | During an upgrade the player should wait a certain amount of time, depending on the significance of the upgrade.                                       | This will slightly limit the speed that players can progress through the game and is a common feature of clicker games.                                                            |   |
| 12        | There should be a cool down for when boosts are used.                                                                                                  | Similar to upgrades, cool downs are often used in clicker games to limit the rate at which the player can progress.                                                                |   |
| 13        | There also should be a waiting period for after equipment is purchased while it is being installed.                                                    | Players have to wait during cooldowns in order to prevent the player from progressing too quickly.                                                                                 |   |

| 1         | Experience and leveling system. each level, more experience points are required, and more chance of gaining gym members. | As expected |

| 4         |                                                                                                                          |             |
