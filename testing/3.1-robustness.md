# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess



| Criterion | Description                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 14        | The game should be able to run smoothly and without crashing. |
| 19        | The game needs a system which allows progress to be saved.    |

### Criterion 14

As my game is a web based game, there were no issues with performance and the game can maintain very high frames per second. Also, my survey concluded that the game did not crash at all while being played:&#x20;

### Criterion 19

In my game I implemented a simple functional saving and loading system where the current gamestate is saved to the players local files once the user presses the save button. The user can then reload that saved gamestate once the user presses load. This means that players do not lose progress as they are playing and have to turn off their devices.

Bug testing and performance testing are important stages in the game development process. After designing, coding and refining a game, testing is essential to ensure that the end product delivers a smooth experience to the players. Bug testing uncovers glitches and errors or unintentional behaviours that can disrupt gameplay or even render the game unplayable. Performance testing assesses how the game runs under various conditions, ensuring smooth gameplay across different hardware configurations.

Both tests are crucial to prevent negative user experiences and to ensure that the game is functional for its users.
