# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

Having finished development of my game, I have created a google form which will be completed by the players of my game. The survey will aim to gather informations on these 5 factors:

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the aim of the game easy to understand and the gameplay not too confusing?                              |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls of the game easy to understand and is the game functional?                                |
| 3 - Engaging       | How enjoyable was the game to play and was it a game that you could play for a long time and come back to? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game crash while playing or have any major bugs?                                                  |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Does the game make sense to players and is it balanced and not too difficult or too easy?                  |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15        | The game should have an age rating appropriate for children.                          |
| 16        | The game should be a balanced in that it is challenging, but not extremely difficult. |

### Criterion 15

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows that players of my game believed it was appropriate for all ages. My goals was to have the game being a low PEGI rating as this would make it more accessible to a wider target audience. I have achieved this as this means that the players of my game believe it has no content that would be unsuitable for people under the age of 7, nor does it have too difficult gameplay for children.

### Criterion 16

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows that the majority of players found my game very easy and not challenging. This means that my game is most likely too straightforward and perhaps this would have made it less enjoyable. To make my game less straightforward and thus more engaging, I should have spent more time developing more complex game mechanics to increase the difficulty of the game. Had I organised my time better, I would have implemented more challenging features.

However, the fact that players found my game easy does also mean that the game was suitable for players of all ages and would not have been too challenging for younger players.
