# 1.1 Problem Identification

The videogame industry has become on of the world's fastest growing economic successes and shows no sign of slowing down. The ESA research in 2014 concluded that 59% of Americans play videogames, there is an average of 2 gamers in each videogame playing household in the US - "it is now more probable than not that any stranger you might meet - on any given day - plays video games" (Baker, 2014).

Some studies suggest that video game practice enhances perception and cognition which leads to frequent video game players outperforming non video game players on these measures. Evidence suggests that video game training improves cognitive function on on tasks other than those specific to the game. One theory is that if participants are chosen to perform a task because of their experience, they will outperform someone who is chosen not based on their experience: "belief that you should perform well can influence performance on measures as basic as visual acuity" (Boot et al., 2011).
