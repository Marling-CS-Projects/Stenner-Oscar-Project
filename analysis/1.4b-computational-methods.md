## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of breaking a problem down by removing irrelevant information which is not necessary or needed to complete the task. This ensures that only details which are needed remain in the problem. Abstraction is an significant part of game development as it allows you to reduce complexity of the code and to focus on the most important features of the game. abstraction makes the development of the game more efficient.

The core features of my game that I will include are:

Incremental progression without player interaction

## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
