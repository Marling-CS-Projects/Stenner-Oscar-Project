## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the process of breaking a problem down by removing irrelevant information which is not necessary or needed to complete the task. This ensures that only details which are needed remain in the problem. Abstraction is an significant part of game development as it allows you to reduce complexity of the code and to focus on the most important features of the game. abstraction makes the development of the game more efficient.

The core features of my game that I will include are:

Clicking/ tapping: The primary action in most incremental/clicker games is clicking or tapping on the screen to generate resources.

Resource generation: generating resources (such as gold, diamonds, or energy) through clicking, idle production, or other means.

Upgrades: As players generate resources, they can use them to purchase upgrades that increase resource generation or improve other game mechanics.

Achievements: a system of achievements that players can earn by reaching certain milestones or completing specific tasks.

Prestige system: a "prestige" system, which allows players to reset their progress in exchange for some sort of permanent bonus or reward.

Multipliers: multipliers, which allow players to increase their resource generation rate by a certain percentage.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is a crucial skill in computer science, particularly in the context of designing algorithms and solving complex problems. To think ahead, it is essential to consider preconditions, inputs, and outputs. Preconditions refer to the conditions that must be satisfied before an algorithm or program can be executed. These may include data structures that need to be initialized or certain conditions that must be met in the input data. Inputs refer to the data or information that is fed into an algorithm or program. It is important to carefully consider the inputs that will be used in a particular context to ensure that the algorithm is effective and efficient. Finally, outputs refer to the results or outcomes that are produced by an algorithm or program. Thinking ahead involves considering the outputs that will be required and designing the algorithm to produce the desired output efficiently and effectively.

Thinking ahead is important for me as it will allow me to visualise my game and what it will look like before actually creating it. This also helps provide an outline and steps to take during development of the game
