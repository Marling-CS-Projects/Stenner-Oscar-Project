# 1.2 Stakeholders

Videogames have an enormous target audience and many people enjoy videogames as a way to interact with friends and to pass time. The number of people playing videogames is also increasing very fast as videogames become more accessible to a wider audience.

UK videogame sales were Â£2,626m in 2006 and growing at 17%, significantly more than other leisure activities. The average age of players is 33, and less than a third are under 18. Over half of adults between 20 and 55 play videogames at least occasionally, and 17% of adults over 18 play video games in any one week (Molesworth, 2009). A survey conducted by the Entertainment Software Association concluded that in 2020, people over 65 report that they have been playing videogames for 10 years or less, meaning that older people are turning to playing computer games. The survey also concluded that more than 214 million people in the US play videogames for one hour or more per week. 75% of all United States households have at least one member who plays videogames.

There are many different reasons why people play video games, including amusement, socialisation, competition, and escapism. Players can become fully immersed in a variety of worlds, stories, and characters through the use of interactive video games. They also give players a chance to socialise, whether it is through playing with friends or interacting with strangers in online forums. Another popular motivation for playing video games is competition, whether it be with other players or with oneself to earn better scores and finish difficult levels. Finally, playing video games provides an escape from the stress and routine of daily life by letting players discover new worlds and identities and feeling a sense of pleasure and achievement after achieving goals and getting through challenges.

## PEGI age ratings

The age ratings for video games in Europe are standardised under the PEGI (Pan European Game Information) label. The ratings are made to let customers, especially parents, know whether a game is appropriate for a given age group depending on its content. All video games that are sold in retail stores or online in participating nations are covered by the PEGI system. A panel of experts reviews the game's content and assigns a rating based on how appropriate it is for players of different ages. The ratings run from 3 (appropriate for everyone) to 18 (only appropriate for adults). Violence, sexual material, drug usage, foul language, discrimination, and online interactions are all taken into account.

My game will be a PEGI 3 as I do not intend to feature any content in my game that could be unsuitable to children. I also intend to make my game accessible to as wide of an audience as possible.
