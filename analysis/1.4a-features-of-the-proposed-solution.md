# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Broad Category 1

**Controls**

Clicker games generally do not have complex controls and usually involve simply clicking buttons that are on the screen using the right mouse button. However to make the game easier to play and more interesting, I will add shortcuts for certain sections and buttons featured in the game. This will also allow for faster paced gameplay and player will be able to perform activities in the game at a faster speed.

**Graphics**

My game will most likely not use complex artwork or graphics as it is not necessary. My game will consist of buttons and perhaps simple artwork in order to help the player understand certain aspects of the game and to help visualise them. Creating complex graphics will be very time consuming and as I have very limited time, more time will be invested into making the game functional rather than designing graphics.

**Layout and Design**

My game will mostly feature simple buttons, text and some images for visualisation throughout my game. This is because clicker games and IDLE games do not need to have complex layouts and designs. I will likely have a few different sections with different layouts which will make up different aspects of the game, for example inventory, map, quests etc.

## Limitations
