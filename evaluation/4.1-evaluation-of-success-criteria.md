### Criterion 1

Experience and leveling system. each level, more experience points are required, and more chance of gaining gym members.

This has been achieved as under player stats, there is a player level which is increased as the player gains xp. through testing my game, I have noticed that the number of members increases at a faster rate, the higher level that the player is. I have also made it so that each time the player levels up via upgrading gym equipment, the amount of xp that the player must gain to level up again, also increases.

### Criterion 2

Boosts that can be purchased with in-game currency to provide temporary bonuses to the player's performance.

I have achieved this as there is a shop where the player can purchase boosts. I struggled while finding a way to definitively test this, however I believe that it is functional.

### Criterion 3

A challenge system that provides extra rewards for completing specific challenges.

This was not achieved because I did not think I had the time. However, a way I could have implemented this would have been to create a large list of unique challenges, which the game will cycle through as the player completes. There could be a maximum of 3 challenges being presented to the player at a time, and the game could cycle between a larger list of challenges each time the player completes one of them. Perhaps there could be a cool down as this would prevent the player from completing every challenge too quickly and getting the same challenges each time.

### Criterion 4

A list of tasks and daily objectives at the top of the screen which can guide the player and help earn rewards.

This was not achieved as, similar to the challenges system, I did not believe I had the time to create such a large list of unique challenges which would be cycled through and presented to the player each day.

### Criterion 5

A system which allows players to hire staff members, similar to managers, which can be levelled up and organised to increase the rate of progression.

This feature was not achieved as I did not know how I could have implemented managers and staff members. I had studied other clicker games but could not think of a way to implement them into my game. If I were to add this feature I would most likely make it so that each manager is permanent and can be levelled up to automatically purchase upgrades for the player.

### Criterion 6

Different equipment which can be leveled up and progressed  separately.

This was achieved as I created html elements for a treadmill, dumbbells, and a barbell. These pieces of gym equipment can be leveled up and will change the appearance of the gym. I have done this by having each piece of equipment represented as a different coloured square. When the equipment is leveled up, the piece of equipment becomes a darker shade of that colour.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 7

An interactive map where the player can view progression.

This has been achieved in that on the right side of the screen there is the map of the gym, the gym equipment can be interacted with and leveled up and the player can be moved with the arrow keys around the map of the gym.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 8

In-game events that provide extra rewards and challenges for a limited time.

This was not achieved as I simply could not find a way to make random in game events. I also think it would have taken a very long time to create a list of events and is something I would have implemented given more time.

### Criterion 9

There will be NPCs who wander the environment.

This was not achieved as I ran out of time. I was about to add this feature by having it so that each time a member joins the gym, a new html element was created which represents a member of the gym. I then would have had them move around the gym environment and perhaps interact with the equipment in some way.

### Criterion 10

There will be a shop where the player can make purchases.

I have achieved this as there is a shop and an in game currency system. The player can use money earned from gaining new gym members to purchase xp boosts from the shop.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 11

During an upgrade the player should wait a certain amount of time, depending on the significance of the upgrade.

This was not achieved as I just did not get to adding it. I would have made the gym equipment aspect of my game more complex and had upgrade cool downs and attributes which equipment affects.

If I were to implement this feature I would have the button to upgrade equipment greyed out after the player clicks it and I would have added a progress bar to display the amount of time left to complete the equipment upgrade.

### Criterion 12

There also should be a waiting period for after equipment is purchased while it is being installed.

I failed to achieve  customisation of the players gym and the ability to add equipment other than dumbbells, treadmill, barbell.

### Criterion 13

The game should require low device specifications to run.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>1 being not smoothly and 5 being very smoothly</p></figcaption></figure>

This shows that everyone who played my game thought the game ran smoothly which means that it likely can be run on a range of hardware configurations.

### Criterion 14

The game should be able to run smoothly and without crashing.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows that everyone who played my game experienced no crashes while playing.

### Criterion 15

The game should have an age rating appropriate for children.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows that there is no content within my game that is not appropriate for children or that is too difficult for children to understand or complete.

### Criterion 16

The game should be a balanced in that it is challenging, but not extremely difficult.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>1 being extremely easy and 5 being extremely hard</p></figcaption></figure>

This shows that my game was perhaps a little too easy and I should have made some features and aspects of my game play more difficult and complex.

### Criterion 17

The gameplay must be engaging and enticing for the player.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>1 being extremely interesting and 5 being not interesting at all</p></figcaption></figure>

This shows that my game was not particularly interesting to play and I believe this to be because the game is too slow paced and not difficult enough.

### Criterion 18

The game should not feature any content that would not be suitable for persons under the age of 7.

This has been achieved as the survey concluded that everyone who played my game deemed it to be suitable for people of all ages, including children under 7.

### Criterion 19

The game needs a system which allows progress to be saved.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows that everyone who played my game understood and was able to use the saving and loading system I have implemented into my game.
