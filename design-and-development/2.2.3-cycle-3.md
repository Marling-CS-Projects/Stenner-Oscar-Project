# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to add higher level cursors and to also begin to create the environment of the gym which will eventually display the players progress. The character should be able to move around the gym which will likely look like a cube moving around a box by clicking the arrow keys.

The movable player will make the game more immersive and the game will no longer just be clicking buttons and increasing numbers. The higher level cursors will add more challenge to the game and create more opportunities for achievements and for features of the gym.

* [x] Level 2 cursor which is significantly faster at increasing score than the first cursor
* [x] Environment which the player can move around in with the arrow keys

### Usability features

### key variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Character     | The character which can be controlled by the player.                                                                                                |

| mapWidth      | The width of the map of the gym.                                                                                                                    |
| mapHeight     | The height of the map of the gym.                                                                                                                   |
| characterX    | The X position of the character at spawn.                                                                                                           |
| characterY    | The Y position of the character at spawn.                                                                                                           |
| cursors2      | The number of level 2 cursors and the rate at which score increases multiplied by 3.                                                                |
| cursor2Cost   | The cost to purchase a level 2 cursor which starts at 1200 and is multiplied by 1.5 every time the user purchases one.                              |

### pseudocode

```
every 100 milliseconds do
    set text of element with id "multiplierbutton" to "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
    set text of element with id "multipliers" to "cursors:: " + cursors
    set text of element with id "clicks" to "clicks: " + score
    call checkAchievements()
```

The pseudocode for updating the HTML elements every 100ms.

## Development

```javascript
setInterval (function() {
  document.getElementById("multiplierbutton").innerText = "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
  document.getElementById("multipliers").innerText = "cursors:: " + cursors
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
  checkAchievements()
}, 100);
```

The first thing I did in this cycle was make it so that the elements on the web page are all updated every 1/10 of a second, or 100ms. This means that the user will no longer have to click "Check Achievements" to update the achievements list and the list will update seemingly instantly as the player reaches each milestone.

```javascript
const character = document.createElement("div");
character.id = "character";
character.style.position = "absolute";
character.style.width = "50px";
character.style.height = "50px";
character.style.background = "blue";
character.style.top = "50%";
character.style.left = "50%";
document.getElementById("map").appendChild(character);

const mapWidth = 300;
const mapHeight = 300;
```

This code creates the character that the player will use, the character is a blue 50x50 square that will be ued to represent the player. By appending character to map then the character becomes part of the map and can move around withing the boundaries of the map when its position is updated.

```javascript
let cursor2Cost = 1200;
let cursors2 = 0;
```

To create a second cursor, I firstly created two new variables, cursor2Cost, and cursors2. Both of these names will be changed to more gym themed names in the future. The second level of cursors are significantly more expensive as they will be more valuable.

```javascript
function purchaseCursor2() {
  if (score>=cursor2Cost) {
    score -= cursor2Cost;
    cursors2++;
    cursor2Cost *=1.5;
    document.getElementById("multiplier2button").innerText = "Purchase level 2 cursor" + "[" + cursor2Cost + "]"
    document.getElementById("multipliers2").innerText = "level 2 cursors:: " + cursors2
    document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
  }
} 
```

I then copied the first cursor function and changed all of the names of the variables and HTML element IDs so that they related to level 2 cursors.

```html
  <button id="multiplier2button" onclick="purchaseCursor2()">Purchase level 2 cursor</button>
  <p id="multipliers2"></p>
```

I then created the button to purchase a level 2 cursor and linked it to the purchaseCursor2 function. This makes it so that when clicked it will increase the cost and level and decrease the score by the cursor2Cost.

```javascript
setInterval (function() {
  if(cursors>0) {
    score +=cursors+cursors2*3;
  }
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
}, 1000);
```

I have updated this function so that each second, the score increases by the sum of cursors and cursors2\*3. This means that once the player purchases level 2 cursors, the rate of score increases significantly.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I now have a function which is called every 100ms, which updates the HTML elements. Meaning that the player no longer has to manually check the achievements to update the list and the game will update the list automatically.

I also have created a second cursor, currently called cursors2, which further increases the rate at which score increases. The cursors2 also costs significantly more to purchase because it is worth more. This makes the game more difficult and more interesting as there is more to work towards. In the future, this will also allow me to create equipment that can be leveled up inside the gym.

I have created a very simple environment for the character and the gym. The character is a blue square and the map is a larger black outline of a square. This will make the game more interesting as the character can move around the gym as they progress and level up the gym.

### Challenges

Once I had created the level 2 cursor and made the button and required HTML elements, the button to purchase the cursor appeared, but the users number of those cursors and the cost to purchase the cursors did not show up.
