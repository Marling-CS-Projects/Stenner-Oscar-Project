# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to add higher level cursors and to also begin to create the environment of the gym which will eventually display the players progress. The character should be able to move around the gym which will likely look like a cube moving around a box by clicking the arrow keys.

The movable player will make the game more immersive and the game will no longer just be clicking buttons and increasing numbers. The higher level cursors will add more challenge to the game and create more opportunities for achievements and for features of the gym.

* [ ] Level 2 cursor which is significantly faster at increasing score than the first cursor
* [ ] Environment which the player can move around in with the arrow keys

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Character     | The character which can be controlled by the player.                                                                                                |
| Score         | The value of the players score, increased by one when clicked, or increased by the value of "cursors" every second, once cursors is greater than 0. |
|               |                                                                                                                                                     |
|               |                                                                                                                                                     |

### pseudocode

```
every 100 milliseconds do
    set text of element with id "multiplierbutton" to "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
    set text of element with id "multipliers" to "cursors:: " + cursors
    set text of element with id "clicks" to "clicks: " + score
    call checkAchievements()
```

## Development

```javascript
setInterval (function() {
  document.getElementById("multiplierbutton").innerText = "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
  document.getElementById("multipliers").innerText = "cursors:: " + cursors
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
  checkAchievements()
}, 100);
```

The first thing I did in this cycle was make it so that the elements on the web page are all updated every 1/10 of a second, or 100ms. This means that the user will no longer have to click "Check Achievements" to update the achievements list and the list will update seemingly instantly as the player reaches each milestone.
