# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to add higher level cursors and to also begin to create the environment of the gym which will eventually display the players progress. The character should be able to move around the gym which will likely look like a cube moving around a box by clicking the arrow keys.

The movable player will make the game more immersive and the game will no longer just be clicking buttons and increasing numbers. The higher level cursors will add more challenge to the game and create more opportunities for achievements and for features of the gym.

* [ ] Level 2 cursor which is significantly faster at increasing score than the first cursor
* [ ] Environment which the player can move around in with the arrow keys

| mapWidth      | The width of the map of the gym.                                                                                                                    |
| mapHeight     | The height of the map of the gym.                                                                                                                   |
| characterX    | The X position of the character at spawn.                                                                                                           |

### pseudocode

```
every 100 milliseconds do
    set text of element with id "multiplierbutton" to "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
    set text of element with id "multipliers" to "cursors:: " + cursors
    set text of element with id "clicks" to "clicks: " + score
    call checkAchievements()
```

The pseudocode for updating the HTML elements every 100ms.

## Development

```javascript
setInterval (function() {
  document.getElementById("multiplierbutton").innerText = "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
  document.getElementById("multipliers").innerText = "cursors:: " + cursors
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
  checkAchievements()
}, 100);
```

The first thing I did in this cycle was make it so that the elements on the web page are all updated every 1/10 of a second, or 100ms. This means that the user will no longer have to click "Check Achievements" to update the achievements list and the list will update seemingly instantly as the player reaches each milestone.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I now have a function which is called every 100ms, which updates the HTML elements. Meaning that the player no longer has to manually check the achievements to update the list and the game will update the list automatically.

I also have created a second cursor, currently called cursors2, which further increases the rate at which score increases. The cursors2 also costs significantly more to purchase because it is worth more. This makes the game more difficult and more interesting as there is more to work towards. In the future, this will also allow me to create equipment that can be leveled up inside the gym.

I have created a very simple environment for the character and the gym. The character is a blue square and the map is a larger black outline of a square. This will make the game more interesting as the character can move around the gym as they progress and level up the gym.
