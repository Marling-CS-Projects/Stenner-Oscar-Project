# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to create a leveling system for the equipment in the gym. This will add functionality to the equipment and they will no longer just be cubes on the screen. By having the equipment with levels, the game and the gym will be more interactive and interesting for the player and will provide more goals for the player to work toward.

To display the level of the equipment, I would like to have the different pieces of equipment change colour as they are leveled up.

* [x] Equipment levels
* [x] Colour changes with equipment leveling

### pseudocode

```
FUNCTION upgradeEquipment(equipment)
    IF equipment IS "treadmill" THEN
        IF score IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO treadmillLevel MULTIPLIED BY 100 THEN
            SUBTRACT treadmillLevel MULTIPLIED BY 100 FROM score
            INCREMENT treadmillLevel BY 1
            SET background color of element with id "treadmill" to RGB value based on treadmillLevel
            SET text of element with id "treadmillbutton" to "Upgrade Treadmill" FOLLOWED BY treadmillLevel MULTIPLIED BY 100
        END IF
    ELSE IF equipment IS "dumbbells" THEN
        IF score IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO dumbbellLevel MULTIPLIED BY 150 THEN
            SUBTRACT dumbbellLevel MULTIPLIED BY 150 FROM score
            INCREMENT dumbbellLevel BY 1
            SET background color of element with id "dumbbells" to RGB value based on dumbbellLevel
            SET text of element with id "dumbbellsbutton" to "Upgrade Dumbbells" FOLLOWED BY dumbbellLevel MULTIPLIED BY 150
        END IF
    ELSE IF equipment IS "barbell" THEN
        IF score IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO barbellLevel MULTIPLIED BY 200 THEN
            SUBTRACT barbellLevel MULTIPLIED BY 200 FROM score
            INCREMENT barbellLevel BY 1
            SET background color of element with id "barbell" to RGB value based on barbellLevel
            SET text of element with id "barbellbutton" to "Upgrade Barbell" FOLLOWED BY barbellLevel MULTIPLIED BY 200
        END IF
    END IF
    SET text of element with id "clicks" to "clicks: " FOLLOWED BY score
END FUNCTION
```

## Development

```javascript
let treadmillLevel = 1;
let dumbbellLevel = 1;
let barbellLevel = 1;
```

When adding a levelling system for equipment, I first declared the variables treadmillLevel, dumbbellLevel, and barbellLevel as the levels of each piece of equipment.

```javascript
function upgradeEquipment(equipment) {
  switch (equipment) {
    case 'treadmill':
      if (score >= treadmillLevel * 100) {
        score -= treadmillLevel * 100;
        treadmillLevel++;
        document.getElementById("treadmill").style.background = `rgb(${255 - treadmillLevel * 10}, 0, 0)`;
        document.getElementById("treadmillbutton").innerText = "Upgrade Treadmill [" + treadmillLevel * 100 + "]"
      }
      break;
    case 'dumbbells':
      if (score >= dumbbellLevel * 150) {
        score -= dumbbellLevel * 150;
        dumbbellLevel++;
        document.getElementById("dumbbells").style.background = `rgb(0, ${255 - dumbbellLevel * 10}, 0)`;
        document.getElementById("dumbbellsbutton").innerText = "Upgrade Dumbbells [" + dumbbellLevel * 150 + "]"
      }
      break;
    case 'barbell':
      if (score >= barbellLevel * 200) {
        score -= barbellLevel * 200;
        barbellLevel++;
        document.getElementById("barbell").style.background = `rgb(0, 0, ${255 - barbellLevel * 10})`;
        document.getElementById("barbellbutton").innerText = "Upgrade Barbell [" + barbellLevel * 200 + "]"
      }
      break;
  }
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score;
}
```

This function "upgradeEquipment" takes the variable "equipment" as a paramater. When the button to upgrade each piece of equipment is pressed, this function is called with either "treadmill", "barbell", or "dumbbells" passed to it.&#x20;

If the player's score is greater than the cost to upgrade the equipment, the the value of "treadmillLevel", "barbellLevel", or "dumbbellLevel" increases by 1.

The colour of the equipment is then changed according to the level of the equipment and the displayed cost to upgrade the equipment increases by varying amounts depending on which gym equipment is being upgraded.

This makes it so that it becomes more difficult to upgrade the gym equipment and the player requires more score as they progress.

```html
  <button id="treadmillbutton" onclick="upgradeEquipment('treadmill')">Upgrade Treadmill</button>
  <button id="dumbbellsbutton" onclick="upgradeEquipment('dumbbells')">Upgrade Dumbbells</button>
  <button id="barbellbutton" onclick="upgradeEquipment('barbell')">Upgrade Barbell</button>
```

This HTML creates 3 buttons, one which allows the player to upgrade the treadmill, one which allows the player to upgrade the dumbbells and one to upgrade the barbell. On the click of each button, the "upgradeEquipment" function is called with its according argument.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I have created a leveling system for the objects in my gym so far, which are treadmill, barbell, and dumbbells. The player increases the level of each of them by purchasing upgrades with score.

As the player upgrades the gym apparatus and the level increases, the colour of the object gets darker and the price to upgrade the equipment gets higher.

### Challenges

I did not face many difficulties creating this cycle, however I did make mistakes when creating the buttons and found it difficult to display the price of the upgrades.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions            | What I expect                                                                                 | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Click upgrade treadmill | The colour of the treadmill should darken and the price to upgrade it again should increase.  | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Click upgrade dumbbels  | The colour of the dumbbels should darken and the price to upgrade them again should increase. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Click upgrade barbell   | The colour of the barbell should darken and the price to upgrade it again should increase.    | As expected           | Pass      |
