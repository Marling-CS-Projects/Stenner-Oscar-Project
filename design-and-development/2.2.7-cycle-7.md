# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I am going to add a player/gym xp and levelling system. Every improvement that the player makes to their gym will give the player xp which will contribute to an overall gym level and experience bar. This will allow me to make it so that the chance of the player getting a new member is affected by the xp/level of the gym. In the previous cycle I wanted to make it so that the level of equipment determines the chance that new members join. However I thought it would be too difficult to make it so that each equipment upgrade directly increases the chance of getting a new member. Instead of this, I can make it so that every upgrade of gym equipment gives the player xp, and then the more xp that the user has, the higher chance new members will join.

I also would like to limit the number of members the player can have depending on what level their gym is. This will prevent the player from progressing too fast and therefore make the game more difficult and more enjoyable.

* [x] Player/gym xp levelling system
* [x] Xp increases the chance of new members joining
* [ ] Limit on Members depending on players level and xp

### pseudocode

```
Function checkForLevelUp
    Initialize xpNeeded as 100 plus (playerLevel times 50)

    IF playerXP is greater than or equal to xpNeeded THEN
        Deduct xpNeeded from playerXP
        Increment playerLevel by 1
        Update the "playerLevel" text on the screen with the new playerLevel value
    END IF
End Function
```

```
Function tryAddMember
    Initialize baseChance as 0.05
    Initialize additionalChance as 0.01 times the result of playerLevel divided by 5 and rounded down
    Initialize totalChance as the sum of baseChance and additionalChance

    IF a random number between 0 and 1 is less than or equal to totalChance THEN
        Increment membersCount by 1
    END IF
End Function
```

## Development

```javascript
let playerXP = 0;
let playerLevel = 1;
```

Firstly, to create the xp system, I declared two new variables, "playerXP" and "playerLevel". This will mean that the player begins at level 1 and will allow me to make it so that the more xp that the player gathers, the higher level the player will reach.

```html
<p id="playerLevel">Player Level: 1</p>
```

I have added this to the HTML in the "Your Gym Stats" section so that the players level can be displayed while playing.

```javascript
function checkForLevelUp() {
  let xpNeeded = 100 + (playerLevel * 50);

  if (playerXP >= xpNeeded) {
      playerXP -= xpNeeded;
      playerLevel++;
      document.getElementById("playerLevel").innerText = "Player Level: " + playerLevel;
  }
}
```

This function "checkForLevelUp" declares a new variable "xpNeeded". I have made it so that the amount of xp you need to reach the next level increases by 50 every time you level up. This function checks if the player has enough xp and if the player does, then the XP is reset and the players level increases by 1. It also updates the display so that the players level is displayed while playing the game.

This function will be called every time the player upgrades equipment in the gym.

```javascript
playerXP += 10 + (barbellLevel * 5);
        checkForLevelUp();
```

Inside the "upgradeEquipment" function I have added this code to dumbbells, barbell, and treadmill which makes it so that the playerXP is increased every time the player upgrades gym equipment. The checkForLevelUp function is then called to see if the player has enough XP for the players level to increase.

```javascript
function tryAddMember() {
  let baseChance = 0.05;
  let additionalChance = 0.01 * Math.floor(playerLevel / 5);
  let totalChance = baseChance + additionalChance;

  if (Math.random() <= totalChance) {
      membersCount++;
  }
}
```

I have also updated the "tryAddMember" function so that the chances of a new member joining is increased when the player levels up. This code makes it so that every 5 levels that the player reaches, the chance of a new member joining increases by 1%.

I have done this to make the game more interesting as this will cause more members to join as the players gym improves.

```javascript
cursorCost = Math.round(cursorCost * 1.5);
cursor2Cost = Math.round(cursor2Cost * 1.5);
cursor3Cost = Math.round(cursor3Cost * 1.5);
```

I also have added these lines of code to "puchaseCursor", "purchaseCursor2", and "purchaseCursor3" functions respectively. This makes it so that the cost and score to not become large decimals as the player purchases more cursors by rounding the cost down to an integer.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle I have created an xp and levelling system which makes it so that the chance of a new member joining the players gym increases as the player upgrades the gym.

I also have fixed the decimal problem, where as the player purchases cursors, the cursorCost and the score would become a very large decimal.

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced were making the chance of a new member increase with the xp level. It was difficult to make the chance increase every 5 levels.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                             | What I expect                                                   | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | XP levelling system                                      | Under "Your Gym Stats" it should display players level.         | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Level increases when equipment is upgraded               | The player will level up when equipment is upgraded.            | As expected           | Pass      |
| 3    | Higher chance of member joining as the player levels up. | Every 5 levels, the chance of a member joining increases by 5%. | As expected           | Pass      |
