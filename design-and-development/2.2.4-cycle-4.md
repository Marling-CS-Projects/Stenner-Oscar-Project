# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to develop game play of my game and add equipment to the gym environment I have created. This will make the game more functional and bring me closer to my original vision for my game as players will be able to upgrade the gym based on what I add to the environment. Eventually, the character will be able to upgrade each piece of equipment and as the player purchases cursors, the appearance of the gym will change.

I also would like to add 2 more levels of cursors, which again will increase the rate of the score and this will allow me to add more content to the actual gym, which is ideally the main focus of the game.

* [x] Level 2 Cursor
* [x] Level 3 Cursor
* [ ] Objects and equipment in the gym.

| equipment     | Represents the piece of equipment which is added to the map. The equipment variable is used in the createEquipment function. |

### Pseudocode

## Development

```javascript
const mapWidth = 500;
const mapHeight = 500;
```

I firstly changed the boundaries which the character could move around in. The map is 500 pixels by 500 pixels which meant that the map had previously been bigger than the character was able to move around in.

```javascript
document.getElementById("multiplier2button").innerText = "Purchase level 2 cursor" + "[" + cursor2Cost + "]"
```

I added this line to the beginning of the code which means that the cost of a level 2 cursor is displayed as soon as the user loads the game.

```javascript
setInterval (function() {
  document.getElementById("multiplierbutton").innerText = "Purchase cursor" + "[" + cursorCost + "]"
  document.getElementById("multipliers").innerText = "cursors: " + cursors
  document.getElementById("multiplier2button").innerText = "Purchase level 2 cursor" + "[" + cursor2Cost + "]"
  document.getElementById("multipliers2").innerText = "level 2 cursors: " + cursors2;
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
  checkAchievements()
}, 100);
```

I updated the setInterval function so that it includes updates made to level 2 cursors.

```javascript
function purchaseCursor3() {
  if (score>=cursor3Cost) {
    score -= cursor3Cost;
    cursors3++;
    cursor3Cost *=1.8;
    document.getElementById("multiplier3button").innerText = "Purchase level 3 cursor" + "[" + cursor3Cost + "]"
    document.getElementById("multipliers3").innerText = "level 3 cursors: " + cursors3
    document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
  }
} 
```

I then created another function which allows the user to purchase a level 3 cursor which increases the score quicker than the first two cursors I made.

```javascript
document.getElementById("multiplier3button").innerText = "Purchase level 3 cursor" + "[" + cursor3Cost + "]"
  document.getElementById("multipliers3").innerText = "level 3 cursors: " + cursors3;
```

This code was added to the setInterval function which makes it so that the cost and the number of cursors is updated each second with everything else.

```javascript
function createEquipment(id, color, leftPosition, label) {
  const equipment = document.createElement("div");
  equipment.id = id;
  equipment.style.position = "absolute";
  equipment.style.width = "50px";
  equipment.style.height = "50px";
  equipment.style.background = color;
  equipment.style.left = `${leftPosition}px`;
  equipment.style.top = `10px`;
  equipment.innerHTML = `<p style="color:white; font-size:10px; text-align:center;">${label}</p>`;
  document.getElementById("map").appendChild(equipment);
}

createEquipment("treadmill", "red", 10, "Treadmill");
createEquipment("dumbbells", "green", 70, "Dumbbells");
createEquipment("barbell", "blue", 130, "Barbell");
```

The function createEquipment is defined to create a piece of gym equipment. It takes four parameters: the equipment's id, color, leftPosition, and the equipment's name/what it will be labelled as when the game is loaded.

A new div element is created to represent the equipment. The properties of this element (its position, size, color, etc.) are then set based on the arguments passed to the function. The name is added to label each equipment. It is then added to the map.

The function is called three times to create three pieces of equipment: a treadmill, dumbbells, and a barbell.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I have fixed the level 2 cursor function. Now when the game is loaded, a button shows up which allows the player to purchase a level 2 cursor which will increase the rate at which score increases significantly. I have also added a level 3 cursor which is more valuabe and more expensive.

I also have created equipment which can be seen on the map of the gym when the game is loaded. I have added a treadmill, a barbell, and dumbbells which appear as coloured cubes in the gym.

### Challenges

It took me a while to figure out how to add the label to each piece of equipment in the gym.

I also found it difficult to get the equipment to appear in the gym because I forgot to append it to the map.

## Testing

### Tests
