# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to develop game play of my game and add equipment to the gym environment I have created. This will make the game more functional and bring me closer to my original vision for my game as players will be able to upgrade the gym based on what I add to the environment. Eventually, the character will be able to upgrade each piece of equipment and as the player purchases cursors, the appearance of the gym will change.

I also would like to add 2 more levels of cursors, which again will increase the rate of the score and this will allow me to add more content to the actual gym, which is ideally the main focus of the game.

* [ ] Level 2 Cursor
* [ ] Level 3 Cursor
* [ ] Objects and equipment in the gym.
