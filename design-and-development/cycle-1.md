# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this phase are to create the JavaScript project and to create the basic layout for the environment in my game and to create a basic layout of where each of the buttons will be. This will allow me to begin working out functionality of these buttons.

* [x] Create the JavaScript project
* [x] Create a button which can be clicked to increase the value of "clicks" which is displayed to the user
* [ ] Create a cursor system which can be bought to automate clicks

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clicks        | Increases by one when the button is clicked and displays the value to the user.            |
| Cursors       | The number of cursors the user has. Once the user purchases a cursor, clicks is automated. |
| cursorCost    | The cost to purchase cursors.                                                              |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I have created two buttons and a clicking system. When the button is clicked, the players score increases by one, this is the main feature of clicker games. This will allow me to create a shop system where players can use their score to purchase upgrades. I have also written a few functions, which do not yet work, but can be used when creating the shop and upgrades and boosts.

### Challenges

A challenge I faced was getting the display to update after being clicked. The value of clicks would increase but the web page did not show the number increasing.

## Testing

Evidence for testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Thing happens     | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press buttons | Something happens | As expected           | Pass      |
