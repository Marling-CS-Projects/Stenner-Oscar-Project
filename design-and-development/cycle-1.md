# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this phase are to create the JavaScript project and to create the basic layout for the environment in my game and to create a basic layout of where each of the buttons will be. This will allow me to begin working out functionality of these buttons.

* [ ] Create the JavaScript project
* [ ] Create a button which can be clicked to increase the value of "clicks" which is displayed to the user
* [ ] Create a cursor system which can be bought to automate clicks
