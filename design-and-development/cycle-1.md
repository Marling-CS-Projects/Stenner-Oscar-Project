## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this phase are to create the JavaScript project and to create the basic layout for the environment in my game and to create a basic layout of where each of the buttons will be. This will allow me to begin working out functionality of these buttons.

* [ ] Create the JavaScript project
* [ ] Create the layout of the game environment
* [ ] Create the most important buttons
* [ ] Create a button which can be clicked to increase the value of a variable "clicks" by 1 and display the number of clicks to the user
