# 2.2.8 Cycle 8

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I would like to create some form of shop where the player can purchase Items or boosts and can spend the money which is gained from membership subscriptions. This will make the currency worth something and will make the game more immersive.

* [x] Shop for the player
* [x] Player can use currency to purchase Item from the shop
* [x] Alert to say what the player has purchased

### Usability features

### key variables

| Variable Name     | Use                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| playerMoney       | The amount of money the player has, which can be used to purchase items from the shop.                               |
| xpBoostActive     | A boolean value which is false by default until the user purchases a boost, when it will become true for 30 minutes. |
| playerXP          | Is easier to increase when the player has an active xp boost.                                                        |
| memberBoostActive | A boolean value which is false by default until the user purchases a boost, when it will become true for 30 minutes. |

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION purchaseItem(itemName, itemCost):
    IF playerMoney IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO itemCost THEN
        DECREASE playerMoney BY itemCost
        DISPLAY "You've purchased [itemName]!"
        CALL updateMoneyDisplay()
    ELSE
        DISPLAY "Not enough money!"

FUNCTION updateMoneyDisplay():
    UPDATE the on-screen display of 'playerMoneyDisplay' with the value of playerMoney

VARIABLE xpBoostActive IS SET TO false

FUNCTION activateXPBoost():
    SET xpBoostActive TO true
    WAIT for 30 minutes THEN
        SET xpBoostActive TO false

FUNCTION gainXP(amount):
    IF xpBoostActive IS true THEN
        INCREASE playerXP BY amount MULTIPLIED BY 2
    ELSE
        INCREASE playerXP BY amount
    ENDIF
    CALL checkForLevelUp()

VARIABLE memberBoostActive IS SET TO false

FUNCTION activateMemberBoost():
    SET memberBoostActive TO true
    WAIT for 30 minutes THEN
        SET memberBoostActive TO false

```

Pseudocode for the gym shop

## Development

```html
<div id="shop">
    <h2>Shop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            XP Boost - Double your XP for 30 minutes - Cost: $50
            <button onclick="purchaseItem('XP Boost', 50)">Buy</button>
        </li>
        <li>
            Special Equipment - Increase member addition chance by 5% for 30 mins - Cost: $100
            <button onclick="purchaseItem('Special Equipment', 100)">Buy</button>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

This is the HTML which displays the shop to the player, the shop is shown as a list and each item has a button which can be pressed to purchase it.

```javascript
function purchaseItem(itemName, itemCost) {
    if (playerMoney >= itemCost) {
        playerMoney -= itemCost;
        alert(`You've purchased ${itemName}!`);
        updateMoneyDisplay();
    } else {
        alert("Not enough money!");
    }
}

function updateMoneyDisplay() {
    document.getElementById('playerMoneyDisplay').innerText = playerMoney;
}

let xpBoostActive = false;

function activateXPBoost() {
    xpBoostActive = true;
    setTimeout(() => {
        xpBoostActive = false;
    }, 30 * 60 * 1000);
}

function gainXP(amount) {
    if (xpBoostActive) {
        playerXP += amount * 2;
    } else {
        playerXP += amount;
    }
    checkForLevelUp();
}

let memberBoostActive = false;

function activateMemberBoost() {
    memberBoostActive = true;
    setTimeout(() => {
        memberBoostActive = false;
    }, 30 * 60 * 1000);
}
```

This is the code for the shop in my game. The "purchaseItem" function allows players to buy items if they have sufficient funds. When a purchase is made, the player's money decreases by the item's cost, and an alert is displayed. This enhances player engagement by offering rewards and incentives for accumulating in-game currency.

The "activateXPBoost" function lets players activate a 30-minute double XP boost. During this period, any experience gained is doubled. Such boosts can motivate players to be more active during the boost window, enhancing gameplay duration and involvement.

The "activateMemberBoost" function introduces a boost mechanism for increasing the rate of gaining members. Like the XP boost, it remains active for 30 minutes.

### Outcome

In this cycle I have created a shop which the player can interact with and purchase items with the money earned from gaining members to the gym. In the shop there are two boosts which can be purchased to increase the rate at which the player gains xp and to increase the chances of a member joining. Both boosts currently cost $50 and once purchased, an alert will be displayed saying what the player has bought.

### Challenges

Challenges I faced during this cycle were making the boosts last certain amounts of time before stopping. Both boosts last 30 minutes which I accomplished by having xpBoostActive set to true for 30 minutes after a boost is purchased.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions            | What I expect                                                         | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Purchase an xp boost    | An alert should pop up to say that an xp boost has been purchased.    | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Purchase a member boost | An alert should pop up to say that a member boost has been purchased. | As expected           | Pass      |
