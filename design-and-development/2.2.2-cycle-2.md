# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to add higher level cursors and to also begin to create the environment of the gym which will display the players progress. The character should be able to move around the gym which will likely look like a cube moving around a box by clicking the arrow keys.

The movable player will make the game more immersive and the game will no longer just be clicking buttons and increasing numbers. The higher level cursors will add more challenge to the game and create more oppourtunities for achievements and for features of the gym.

* [ ] Level 2 cursor which is significantly faster at increasing score than the first cursor
