# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are automate the clicking process for the user and create an achievements system, where the user can press a button to check achievements. as the player reaches milestones, the achievements list will update and display achievements. Automating the clicking process will allow the user to purchase cursors and increase the rate at which they can gain score and progress.

* [x] Automated clicks
* [x] Achievements

### Usability features

### key variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cursors       | The number of cursors the player has purchased.                                                                                                     |
| cursorCost    | The cost to purchase cursors.                                                                                                                       |
| achievements  | An array which contains true or false for whether each of the achievements are unlocked.                                                            |
| score         | The value of the players score, increased by one when clicked, or increased by the value of "cursors" every second, once cursors is greater than 0. |

### pseudocode

```
function checkAchievements():
    if score >= 10 and achievements[0] == false:
        achievements[0] = true
        Set "Reached score 10" as the text of element with id "achievement1"

    if score >= 100 and achievements[1] == false:
        achievements[1] = true
        Set "Reached score 100" as the text of element with id "achievement2"

    if multiplierCount >= 5 and achievements[2] == false:
        achievements[2] = true
        Set "Unlocked 5 multipliers" as the text of element with id "achievement3"
```

Pseudocode for achievements

```
repeat every 1 second:
    if multiplierCount > 0:
        score = score + multiplierCount + 1
    Set "clicks: " + score as the text of element with id "clicks"
```

Pseudocode for automated clicks

## Development

```javascript
let achievements = [false, false, false];

function checkAchievements() {
  // Achievement 1: Reach a score of 10
  if (score >= 10 && achievements[0]==false) {
    achievements[0] = true;
    document.getElementById("achievement1").innerText = "Reached score 10";
  }

  // Achievement 2: Reach a score of 100
  if (score >= 100 && achievements[1]==false) {
    achievements[1] = true;
    document.getElementById("achievement2").innerText = "Reached score 100";
  }

  // Achievement 3: Purchase 5 multipliers
  if (cursors >= 5 && achievements[2]==false) {
    achievements[2] = true;
    document.getElementById("achievement3").innerText = "Unlocked 5 cursors";
  }
}
```

This creates an array "achievements" which, for each achievement in the "checkAchivements" function, contains a true or false value which is assigned to each if statement. When the user clicks check achievements button, the achievements list will update and the user will be able to view all of their achievements and milestones.

I can add to this function and add values to the array which will allow me to add more achievements for the user to unlock.

```html
<button onclick="checkAchievements()">Check achievements</button>

  <h2>Achievements</h2>
  <ul id="achievements">
    <li id="achievement1">Achievement 1</li>
    <li id="achievement2">Achievement 2</li>
    <li id="achievement3">Achievement 3</li>
  </ul>cript
```

This HTML code creates a button which executes the "checkAchievements" function when cicked, it also creates a list which displays "achievement 1, achievement " etc. This is displayed until the user unlocks the achievement, and the list is updated when the button "Check Achievements" is clicked.

To add more achievements as I continue to create my game, I can simply add new \<li>\</li> elements to the end of the unordered list.

```javascript
setInterval (function() {
  if(cursors>0) {
    score +=cursors;
  }
  document.getElementById("clicks").innerText = "clicks: " + score
}, 1000);
```

This code makes it so that each second, or 1000ms, the value of score increases by 1 each second, only when the player has a cursor count of above 0. This makes it so that the players score increases automatically once they purchase their first cursor.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I have created a new button which can be pressed to check the achievements that the player has unlocked, when the button is pressed, a function "checkAchievements" is executed, which updates the list of achievements and displays to the user which achievements have been unlocked. The list will change from "achievement 1" to "reached score 10" and "achievement 2" to "reached score 100".

I also have created a new function which reapeats every second, where if the user has a cursor count of above 0, then the function will execute every second. This means that if the value of "cursors" is greater than 0, the players score will begin to increase automatically, by 1 each second.

### Challenges

Challenges I faced during this cycle were getting the achievements list to update when achievements are unlocked. This is why I added the "Check Achievements" button. Next cycle I will update this system and use "setInterval" so that all of the HTML elements update every second. This will mean the user does not have to manually update the achievements list to view their achievements, they will be displayed as they are achieved.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions             | What I expect                                                                                                    | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Press check achievements | If any of the achievements have been reached, then the achievements list will update when the button is pressed. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Automatic clicks         | Once the user purchases the first cursor, the value of score increases by 1 or "cursors" every second.           | As expected           | Pass      |
