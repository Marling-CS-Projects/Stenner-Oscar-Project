# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are automate the clicking process for the user and create an achievements system, where the user can press a button to check achievements. as the player reaches milestones, the achievements list will update and display achievements. Automating the clicking process will allow the user to purchase cursors and increase the rate at which they can gain score and progress.

* [x] Automated clicks
* [x] Achievements
