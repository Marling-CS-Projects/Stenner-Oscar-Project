This diagram represents the main aspects of my clicker game which I will be focusing on throughout development in order to stick to my success criteria. The steps to complete the game have been broken down into sections and during development of my game I will focus on each step individually ensuring that enough time is spent on each feature.

## Usability Features

Usability is of paramount importance as the game ideally should be accessible to as wide of an audience as possible. To provide a positive experience to the players, the following aspects must be prioritised.

### Effective

My clicker game should clearly communicate the objectives and goals to the players, the design, controls, and interface should align, making the game intuitive for players to interact with.

#### Aims

* Clearly define in game objectives and ensure players are aware of them.
* Ensure that gameplay mechanics support players in achieving these objectives.

### Efficiency

The games design should minimize unnecessary actions and the controls and user interface of the game should be easy to understand and navigate.

#### Aims

* Have a button layout which allows for fast navigation.
* Have controls which can allow players to effectively interact with my clicker game.

### Engaging

The game should capture and retain players attention. This involves dynamic and interesting gameplay mechanics and rewarding progression and achievement.

#### Aims

* Create a series of mechanics commonly found in clicker games like cursors.
* Implement varying gameplay.

### Error Tolerant

#### Aims

* The game should not crash.
* The game should not contain any major bugs which hinder gameplay.

### Easy To Learn

Clicker games are supposed to be simple and easy to learn. The gameplay should be easy to understand and interact with for the player. The objectives should be clear.
