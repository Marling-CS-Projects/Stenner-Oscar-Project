# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I am going to create a saving and loading system so that the player can save their progress and come back to the version of the game they were playing.

* [x] Save game button
* [x] Load game button

### Usability features

### key variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| save          | An object that stores the current state of various game elements, allowing the player to save and load the game. |
| savedGame     | Represents the saved game data in string format as retrieved from local storage.                                 |
| loadedGame    | Represents the saved game data as a JavaScript object, parsed from the savedGame string.                         |

### pseudocode

```
FUNCTION saveGame:
    DATA save = {
        score, 
        cursorCost, 
        cursors,
        cursor2Cost, 
        cursors2,
        cursor3Cost, 
        cursors3, 
        treadmillLevel, 
        dumbbellLevel, 
        barbellLevel, 
        membersCount, 
        playerMoney, 
        playerXP, 
        playerLevel, 
        achievements
    }
    STORE "gymClickerSave" = save

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION loadGame:
    DATA savedGame = RETRIEVE "gymClickerSave"

    IF savedGame EXISTS:
        DATA loadedGame = CONVERT savedGame
        score = loadedGame.score
        cursorCost = loadedGame.cursorCost
        cursors = loadedGame.cursors
        cursor2Cost = loadedGame.cursor2Cost
        cursors2 = loadedGame.cursors2
        cursor3Cost = loadedGame.cursor3Cost
        cursors3 = loadedGame.cursors3
        treadmillLevel = loadedGame.treadmillLevel
        dumbbellLevel = loadedGame.dumbbellLevel
        barbellLevel = loadedGame.barbellLevel
        membersCount = loadedGame.membersCount
        playerMoney = loadedGame.playerMoney
        playerXP = loadedGame.playerXP
        playerLevel = loadedGame.playerLevel
        achievements = loadedGame.achievements

    ELSE:
        DISPLAY "No saved game found!"
    END IF

END FUNCTION

```

Pseudocode for game saving system

## Development

```html
 <button onclick="saveGame()">Save Game</button>
 <button onclick="loadGame()">Load Game</button>
```

```javascript
function saveGame() {
  const save = {
      score: score,
      cursorCost: cursorCost,
      cursors: cursors,
      cursor2Cost: cursor2Cost,
      cursors2: cursors2,
      cursor3Cost: cursor3Cost,
      cursors3: cursors3,
      treadmillLevel: treadmillLevel,
      dumbbellLevel: dumbbellLevel,
      barbellLevel: barbellLevel,
      membersCount: membersCount,
      playerMoney: playerMoney,
      playerXP: playerXP,
      playerLevel: playerLevel,
      achievements: achievements
  };

  localStorage.setItem("gymClickerSave", JSON.stringify(save));
}

function loadGame() {
  const savedGame = localStorage.getItem("gymClickerSave");

  if (savedGame) {
      const loadedGame = JSON.parse(savedGame);

      score = loadedGame.score;
      cursorCost = loadedGame.cursorCost;
      cursors = loadedGame.cursors;
      cursor2Cost = loadedGame.cursor2Cost;
      cursors2 = loadedGame.cursors2;
      cursor3Cost = loadedGame.cursor3Cost;
      cursors3 = loadedGame.cursors3;
      treadmillLevel = loadedGame.treadmillLevel;
      dumbbellLevel = loadedGame.dumbbellLevel;
      barbellLevel = loadedGame.barbellLevel;
      membersCount = loadedGame.membersCount;
      playerMoney = loadedGame.playerMoney;
      playerXP = loadedGame.playerXP;
      playerLevel = loadedGame.playerLevel;
      achievements = loadedGame.achievements;
  } else {
      alert("No saved game found!");
  }
}

```

The "saveGame" function compiles the current game state into a singular object named save. This object contains various details like score, equipment levels, achievements, and player stats. Once this data is structured, the system then converts it into a string format using the JSON.stringify() method and saves it to the browser's local storage with the key "gymClickerSave". When a player wants to continue their progress, the "loadGame" function is called, it first checks if there's any saved data within local storage. If found, it retrieves this data, parses it from string back to a JavaScript object using JSON.parse(), and then updates the game's variables with this saved state. If no saved game is found, the player is alerted.

The ability to save progress is important for players as it encourages prolonged engagement with the game. It allows players to pick up from where they left off, ensuring they don't lose their progress. Especially in incremental games where progression might be slow and methodical, the ability to save allows players to close the game and start where they last were.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle, I have a simple game saving system, where the player can save the game locally and then load the game that was last saved.

I have 2 buttons at the top of the screen. One of them "Save Game" saves the current state of the game. The other "Load Game" loads the  last saved state of the game.

This means that players can quit the game, reload it and load their progress and continue where they left off.

### Challenges

I found it confusing trying to load the game having saved it because I initially did not understand .parse() method.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions   | What I expect                                                                                                                                                                | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Save/load game | When the save game button is pressed, the current state of the game is saved locally, and when the load button is pressed, the previously saved state of the game is loaded. | As expected           | Pass      |
