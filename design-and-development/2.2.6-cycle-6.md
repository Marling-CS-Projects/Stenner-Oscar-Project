# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to create a gym membership system where the number of members the player has in their gym is displayed. The number of members determines the players income as the members of the gym will pay a membership fee.

I also would like to make it so that the higher level that the gym equipment is, the easier it is to gain new members to the gym and thus make more money.

* [ ] Gym members system
* [ ] Gym upgrades determine new memberships

### Usability features

### key variables

| Variable Name | Use                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| membersCount  | The number of members in the players gym. |
| playerMoney   | The amount of money that the payer has.   |

### pseudocode

## Development

```javascript
let membersCount = 0;
let playerMoney = 0;
```

When adding the members system to my game I first declared two new variables: membersCount, and playerMoney.
