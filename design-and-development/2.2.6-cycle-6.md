# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

My objectives for this cycle are to create a gym membership system where the number of members the player has in their gym is displayed. The number of members determines the players income as the members of the gym will pay a membership fee.

This will introduce a currency to the game and will allow for more features I can add later on, for example a shop where the player can purchase new equipment.

I also would like to make it so that the higher level that the gym equipment is, the easier it is to gain new members to the gym and thus make more money.

* [x] Gym members system
* [x] Player currency
* [ ] Gym upgrades determine new memberships

### Usability features

### key variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| membersCount  | The number of members in the players gym. Base of 5% chance of a new member joining every 15 seconds. increases slightly when the player upgrades the gym. |
| playerMoney   | The amount of money that the payer has. Increases every 3 minutes and the rate is determined by the amount of members the player has.                      |

### pseudocode

```
FUNCTION tryAddMember
    IF a random number between 0 and 1 IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.05 THEN
        INCREMENT membersCount BY 1
    END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION collectMembershipFees
    playerMoney INCREASES BY (membersCount * 200)
END FUNCTION

REPEAT EVERY 15 seconds
    CALL tryAddMember
END REPEAT

REPEAT EVERY 3 minutes
    CALL collectMembershipFees
END REPEAT
```

## Development

```javascript
let membersCount = 0;
let playerMoney = 0;
```

When adding the members system to my game I first declared two new variables: membersCount, and playerMoney.

```javascript
function tryAddMember() {
    if (Math.random() <= 0.05) {
        membersCount++;
    }
}

function collectMembershipFees() {
    playerMoney += membersCount * 200;
}

setInterval(tryAddMember, 15000);

setInterval(collectMembershipFees, 180000);
```

To implement a gym membership system to my game, I have created two functions, "tryAddMember" and "collectMemberShipFees". The first function is called every 15 seconds, and generates a random number between 0 and 1 and checks if it is smaller than or equal to 0.05. If the number is smaller than or equal to 0.05 then the membersCount variable is incremented by 1.

The second function is called every 3 minutes and represents a subscription fee for members to the gym. Every 3 minutes, the playerMoney variable is increased by 200\*membersCount. This means that the amount paid by each member is $200 every 3 minutes.

I have included this into the game because it creates opportunity for more features and is an actual currency which I can use to create a shop. The shop will allow users to purchase new equipment and other items like limited time boosts etc. This will make the game more immersive and provide more of a purpose and provide more opportunities for customisation to the player.

### Outcome

At the end of this cycle I have a members system for the players gym that will eventually be determined by the level of the players gym and the level of the equipment in the gym. As the player upgrades equipment in the gym, the chances of getting a new member every 15 seconds will increase very slightly.

I now have a currency which I can use to create a shop in the next cycles. This will make the game more immersive and enjoyable for the player.

### Challenges

I found it difficult to make it so that the chance of getting a new member is altered by the level of equipment in the gym and so I am going to change it in the next cycle. Instead of trying to make each upgrade directly affect the chances, I am going to add player xp and levels so that upgrading equipment gives the player xp and as the player levels up, the chance of getting a new member increases slightly. However I also would like to cap the number of members the player can have based on what level they are. This will slow the progression of the game slightly and make it more difficult to progress.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                   | What I expect                                                                                                       | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | New member                     | Every 15 seconds there is a 5% chance that a new gym member will join and the "Your Gym Stats" section will update. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Money/Member Subscription Fee. | Every 3 minutes, the players money will increase by $200 for every gym member they have.                            | As expected           | Pass      |
